    <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
    <para>The <command>bundy-certgen</command> tool validates, creates, or
      updates a self-signed X509 certificate for use in bundy-cmdctl.
    </para>

    <para>
      The connection between <command>bundyctl</command> and
      <command>bundy-cmdctl</command> is done over HTTPS, and therefore
      <command>bundy-cmdctl</command> needs a certificate. Since these
      certificates have expiry dates, they also need to be regenerated at
      some point.

      There are many tools to do so, but for ease of use, <command>
      bundy-certgen</command> can create a simple self-signed certificate.

      By default, it will not create anything, but it will merely check an
      existing certificate (if not specified, cmdctl-certfile.pem, in the
      current working directory). And print whether it is valid, and
      whether it would update if the option '-w' is given.

      With that option, the certificate could then be replaced by a newly
      created one. If the certificate is still valid, it would still not
      be overwritten (however, if it is found to be invalid, for example
      because it has expired, it would create a new one).

      A new certificate is always created if the certificate file does
      not exist, or if creation is forced (with the -f option).

    <title>ARGUMENTS</title>

    <para>The arguments are as follows:</para>

    <variablelist>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>
          <option>-c <replaceable>file</replaceable></option>,
          <option>--certfile=<replaceable>file</replaceable></option>
        </term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            File to read the certificate from, or write the certificate to.
            If <option>-w</option> and <option>-c</option> are used,
            <option>-k</option> is mandatory as well.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>
          <option>-f</option>,
          <option>--force</option>
        </term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Force updating of certificate when <option>-w</option> is used,
            even if the existing certificate is still valid.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>
          <option>-h</option>,
          <option>--help</option>
        </term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Print the command line arguments and exit.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>
          <option>-k <replaceable>file</replaceable></option>,
          <option>--keyfile=<replaceable>file</replaceable></option>
        </term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            File to write the private key to. This option is only valid when <option>-w</option> is used, and if this option is used, <option>-c</option> is mandatory as well.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>
          <option>-w</option>,
          <option>--write</option>
        </term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Check the given certificate file. If it does not exist, a new
            private key and certificate are created. If it does exist, the
            certificate is validated. If it is not valid (for instance
            because it has expired), it is overwritten with a newly created
            certificate. If it is valid, nothing happens (use
            <option>-f</option> to force an update in that case).
          </para>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>

          <option>--quiet</option>
        </term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Don't print informational messages (only command-line errors are
            printed). Useful in scripts when only the return code is needed.

    <title>EXAMPLE</title>
    <para>
      To update an expired certificate in BUNDY that has been installed to
      /usr/local:
      <screen>
$> cd /usr/local/etc/bundy/

$> bundy-certgen
cmdctl-certfile.pem failed to verify: certificate has expired
Running with -w would overwrite the certificate

$> bundy-certgen --write
cmdctl-certfile.pem failed to verify: certificate has expired
Creating key file cmdctl-keyfile.pem
Creating certificate file cmdctl-certfile.pem

$> bundy-certgen --write
cmdctl-certfile.pem is valid
Not creating a new certificate (use -f to force)
