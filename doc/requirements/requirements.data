10011320	If there is no origin (to use for a relative name), it is an error.	-	RFC1035:5.1/15	master-file	-		-
10011330	If there is no origin (to use for a relative name), it is an issue that is usually interpreted as an error; if treated as a warning, the domain name is considered absolute.	TODO: conflicts with 10011320	?	master-file	-	-	-

10011520	If the TTL field is omitted, then it defaults to the previous $TTL directive value; if no $TTL was defined, then it uses the last explicitly defined TTL.	The $TTL supersedes RFC1035:5.1/6, the fallback is if is not defined, is not defined.	RFC2308:4/5	master-file	-	-	-
10011530	If no TTL and no previous $TTL directive nor TTL defined, then this is an issue and is usually interpreted as a warning; ;f interpreted as a warning then the TTL from the last field of the SOA is used, unless the SOA has not yet been seen, in which case must be interpreted as an error.	TODO: where is the concept of using the SOA MINIMUM/NEGATIVE defined?	?	master-file	-	-	-
10011540	All RR's in a set of Resource Records must have the same TTL, unless it is a RRSIG RR; TTLs for RRSIG records must match the TTL value for the RRset that the signature is for.	RFC4034 supersedes RFC2181 for the RRSIG rule.	RFC2181:5.2/2,RFC4034:3/7	master-file	-	-	-

10011560	The RDATA for an unknown type begins with '\#' (backslash-pound), whitespace, the RDATA length in sockets specified with an unsigned decimal integer, whitespace, and then zero or more words of hexadecimal (even nummber of digits) encoding of the data; an empty RDATA can be represented with '\# 0'.	-	RFC3597:5/3,RFC3597:5/4	master-file	-		-
10011570	The generic \# RDATA representation may be used for known types; but if known, the later processing must apply type-specific rules.	-	RFC3597:5/5,RFC3597:5/6	master-file	-		-
10011580	Any error with the generic RDATA format, such as not having enough hexadecimal data for the length, is an issue usually considered an error; if considered as a warning, then the RR is skipped.	TODO: where documented?	?	master-file	-	-	-
