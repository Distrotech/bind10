This is the top directory for sample programs that can be developed
using public BUNDY libraries outside of the BUNDY project.  It's
intended to be built with installed BUNDY header files and library
objects, so it's not a target of the main build tree, and does not
refer to any other part of the BUNDY source tree that contains
this directory.

On the top (sub) directory (where this README file is stored), we
provide a sample configure.ac and Makefile.am files for GNU automake
environments with helper autoconf macros to detect the availability and
location of BUNDY header files and library objects.

You can use the configure.ac and Makefile.am files with macros under
the "m4" subdirectory as a template for your own project.  The key is
to call the AX_ISC_BUNDY function (as the sample configure.ac does)
from your configure.ac.  Then it will check the availability of
necessary stuff and set some corresponding AC variables.  You can then
use the resulting variables in your Makefile.in or Makefile.am.

If you use automake, don't forget adding the following line to the top
level Makefile.am:

ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS = -I m4

This is necessary to incorporate the helper macro definitions.

If you don't use automake but autoconf, make sure to add the following
to the configure.ac file:

sinclude(m4/ax_boost_include.m4)
sinclude(m4/ax_isc_bundy.m4)
(and same for other m4 files as they are added under m4/)

On some systems, especially if you have installed the BUNDY
libraries in an uncommon path, programs linked with the BUNDY
library may not work at run time due to the "missing" shared library.
Normally, you should be able to avoid this problem by making sure
to invoking the program explicitly specifying the path to the library,
e.g., "LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/bundy ./my_bundy_app", or
you may not even notice the issue if you have installed BUNDY
library in a common library path on your system (sometimes you may
still need to run ldconfig(8) beforehand).  Another option is to embed
the path to the library in your program.  While this approach is
controversial, and some people rather choose the alternatives, we
provide a helper tool in case you want to use this option: see the
lines using BUNDY_RPATH in the sample configure.ac file of this
directory.
