What is needed:

 - full IPv6 support (so at least Vista or Server 2008)

 - POSIX (aka Unix) environment for tar/git/etc (I use cygwin)

 - Visual Studio C++ (versions 2008 and 2010 were tested,
  note older versions could fail to correctly compile,
  cf. C4373 warning)

 - python >= 3.1 (I got Cpython 3.2 MSI from python.org,
  note the pre-built python can give C++ runtime issue with
  an incompatible Visual Studio, and botan wants a version 2
  for configuration)

 - perl (the Windows native one, not yet used)

 - sqlite3 >= 3.3.9 (got the 3.7.6 prebuilds but the distrib
  is needed to get the .h and .lib file)

 - splite3 python DSO (included in the MSI, not yet used)

 - cmakefile (got the 2.8.4 .exe, can be used but see below)

 - google test (aka gtest, got the 1.5.0 sources)

 - boost >= 1.35 (got the 1.44 (newer is empty?) setup)

 - setproctitle python module (in theory)

 - botan 1.8.x (compiled from sources to control things, i.e.,
  tried to factorize the (in)convenience with gtest)

 - log4cplus (in the future)

How to compile google test:
 - remove the /MD -> /MT line in the CMakeLists.txt, use cmake

 - *or* open the solution gtest-md in msvc (please note the rights
  of files in this directory must be fixed before)

 - please remember the same Visual Studio version must be used
  for gtest and bind10

 - msvc gives the gtestd.lib (in place of gtest.lib) for the debug version

Where I put things (hardwired paths):
 - <home>\bind10.trac826 for bind10
  (wired in dns tests preprocessor defines)

 - <home>\gtest\include

 - <home>\gtest\md10\{Debug,Release} gtest{d,}.lib and vc100.[ip]db, or,
   <home>\gtest\md9\{Debug,Release} gtest{d,}.lib and vc90.[ip]db

 - <home>\botan\include and <home>\botan\md{9,10}\{Debug,Release}
   (--disable-shared to get static libs, no DLL)

 - "C:\\Program Files\boost\boost_1_44" (the include and
  sometimes the libraries (in lib) too)

 - C:\\Python32 (update your PATH, same for perl)

 - C:\\sqlite3

How to compile:
 - open win32build\VS2010\bind10.sln file with Visual Studio 2010, or,
   open win32build\VS2008\bind10.sln file with Visual Studio 2008

 - fix the paths

 - build

 - partial or todo directory ports are marked

Random notes (for me):
 - getopt() is *not* standard (got working getopt.{h,cc})
 - inet_pton() requires >= Vista/2008
 - forget lcov/pycoverage
 - TODO: find the real cause of asio/boost wanting pthreads
 - cmake?
